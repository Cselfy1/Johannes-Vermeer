            <h2>Biography about johannes Vermeer ðŸŽ¨</h2>
            <p>
                Johannes Vermeer was a Dutch painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. He was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime but evidently was not wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings.

                Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, and frequently used very expensive pigments. He is particularly renowned
                for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.
